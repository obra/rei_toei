# Where we talk about Rei

## IRC

You can probably find some folks on #reitoei on irc.freenode.net.

## Mailing list

rei-dev@groups.google.com is the general all-purpose development mailing list.
As of this writing, the list is brand new, so it'll take a bit of time for
the archives at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rei-dev to be very
worthwhile. 

(That URL is also the right place to go to subscribe to the list)

## GIT

Rei's repository lives at https://github.com/obra/rei_toei - We <3 pull requests.
After 2 accepted pull requests, please feel free to ping a project admin for a commit bit.
(At the moment, Jesse is probably the right person to ping)
