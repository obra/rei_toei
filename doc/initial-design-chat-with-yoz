Rei needs

    a way for it to decide which plugin will handle a query
    knock out plugins as early as possible - before they take up cognitive load
    have the plugins register themselves with a response plugin router.
    some kind of response format.
        deciding which parts of the response are being handled by which layer
        personality is pluggable, maybe?
    philosophy about what kind of experience do we want people to have.
    do we have standards about what standards plugins should meet?
    to what degree should people be tailoring their speech for rei?
    where would we rather have rei say "I don't understand" than do something wrong?
    What kinds of activities do we see her being targeted at?
    "Queries that have something to do with me are the interesting ones"
    "I love the fact that I can ask siri "When's my next appointment with Dr ____""
    Siri is mainly tuned toward querying, rather than acting.
        setting alarms
        moving calendar items
    Siri is not totally stateless.
        we need contextualized stateful flows.
        you should be able to run down a decision tree.
    rei needs to be able to be useful. just a speech interface to google/wikipedia/urbandictionary is "meh"
    What's our target environment?
