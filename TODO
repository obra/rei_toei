The rough plan is to build a commandline bot that runs from node as a small harness around a library, then to build an android phonegap application that uses the library.

Rough order of ops:



DONE

* basic harness that takes a query and returns a response
* plugin api
* plugin system that hands the the parsed query to each plugin and collects
  possible responses with confidence levels
* nlp to give the plugins something better than "regexes on a string"
* local scratch space for short-term memory
* something to load the plugins from separate files
* persistent storage for plugins
* Write a test that actually tests name memoriziation

TODO

* a responder that takes the responses, evaluates their confidence metrics,
  and spits one or more of them back to the user
* give users the ability to +/- plugins
* Build a noun-phrase constructor based on the part of speech tagging we're
    there's a cpan module to cargo cult from
* Document our JS coding standards
* Script total-project linting
* Script total-project code formatting
* Get the weather plugin to only answer weather-related questions
* Get the factoid plugin to only give back factoids when you ASK
* build rei into the phonegap app
* get an iframe-based directions plugin
* make sure each incorporate file contains license and source info
* License the project under apache2
