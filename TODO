The rough plan is to build a commandline bot that runs from node as a small harness around a library, then to build an android phonegap application that uses the library.

Rough order of ops:

* basic harness that takes a query and returns a response
* plugin api
* plugin system that hands the the parsed query to each plugin and collects
  possible responses with confidence levels
* nlp to give the plugins something better than "regexes on a string"
* a responder that takes the responses, evaluates their confidence metrics,
  and spits one or more of them back to the user
* local scratch space for short-term memory
* something to load the plugins from separate files
* persistent storage for plugins
    - is there an abstraction that can work both in phonegap and in node?
* give users the ability to +/- plugins
